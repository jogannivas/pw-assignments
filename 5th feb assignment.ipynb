    "Q1//\n",
    "A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made.\n",
    "An Object is an instance of a Class. A class is like a blueprint while an instance is a copy of the class with actual values. \n",

    "Data abstraction is the most essential function of object-oriented programming in python. Abstraction means displaying only basic information and hiding the details. Data abstraction refers to providing only necessary information about the data to the outside world, hiding the background info or implementation.\n",
    "Encapsulation is defined as wrapping up of data and information under a single unit. In object-oriented programming, Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the functions that manipulate them.\n",
    "Inheritance is the process in which two classes have a relationship with each other, and objects of one class acquire properties and features of the other class. The class which inherits the features is known as the child class, and the class whose features it inherited is called the parent class.\n",
    "The word polymorphism means having many forms. It is the ability to take more than one form. It is a feature that provides a function or an operator with more than one definition. It can be implemented using function overloading, operator overload, function overriding, virtual function.\n",
    "Q3//\n",
    "Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The __init__ function is called every time an object is created from a class. The __init__ method lets the class initialize the object's attributes and serves no other purpose. It is only used within classes.03\n",
