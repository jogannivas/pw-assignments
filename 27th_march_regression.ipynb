        "R-squared, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a statistical measure used to assess the goodness-of-fit of a linear regression model. It indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variable(s) included in the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "The R-squared value ranges between 0 and 1. A value of 0 indicates that the independent variable(s) do not explain any of the variation in the dependent variable, while a value of 1 suggests that the independent variable(s) perfectly explain the observed variation. In practice, R-squared values are typically between 0 and 1, but they can also be negative if the model performs worse than a simple horizontal line.\n",
        "\n",
        "To calculate R-squared, we first compute the total sum of squares (SST), which represents the total variation in the dependent variable. Next, we determine the sum of squares of residuals (SSE), which quantifies the unexplained variation or errors of the model. Finally, we calculate the R-squared as:\n",
        "\n",
        "R-squared = 1 - (SSE / SST)\n",
        "\n",
        "The R-squared value ranges from 0 to 1 because SSE is always positive and is divided by SST, which is also positive. A higher R-squared value indicates a better fit of the model to the data, as it means a larger proportion of the dependent variable's variation is explained by the independent variable(s).\n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to note that R-squared does not determine the causal relationship between variables or the overall quality of the model. A high R-squared does not necessarily imply a good model, nor does a low R-squared mean a bad model. R-squared only measures the proportion of variance explained and does not account for other factors such as model complexity or the presence of multicollinearity. Therefore, it should be interpreted in conjunction with other statistical measures and domain knowledge when assessing a linear regression model."

        "\n",
        "Availability: RMSE, MSE, and MAE are widely implemented in statistical software packages, making them readily available and easy to compute. They are standard evaluation metrics in regression analysis, allowing for consistent comparisons across studies and datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mathematical properties: RMSE, MSE, and MAE are mathematically well-defined metrics, enabling statistical analysis and hypothesis testing based on these measures. They can be used to calculate confidence intervals or conduct significance testing on the model performance.\n",

        "Disadvantages of RMSE, MSE, and MAE as evaluation metrics in regression analysis:\n",

Depending on the specific application, understanding the direction and nature of errors might be crucial.\n",
        "\n",
        "Units and scale dependency: MSE and RMSE are affected by the scale of the dependent variable. The units of these metrics are squared versions of the units of the dependent variable, which can make it difficult to compare models across different scales. MAE, on the other hand, is not scale-dependent and is expressed in the same units as the dependent variable.\n",

        "Sensitivity to outliers: While the sensitivity to outliers can be an advantage, it can also be a disadvantage.

        "Emphasis on large errors: RMSE and MSE place more emphasis on large errors due to their squaring of errors. While this can be useful in certain scenarios, it might not accurately represent the overall model performance if the focus is primarily on minimizing smaller errors."

In situations where including all available features is important, a regularized linear model may not be the best choice."
