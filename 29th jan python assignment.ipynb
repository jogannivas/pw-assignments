    "Q1// who developed python programming language?\n",
    "ans:=\n",
    "Python was created by Guido van Rossum, and first released on February 20, 1991.\n",
    "Q2// which type of programming does python support?\n",
    "ans:=\n",
    "Python is an interpreted programming language, supporting object-oriented, structured, and functional programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3// is python case sensitive with identifiers\n",
    "ans:-\n",
    "Yes, Python is a case-sensitive language, i.e., it treats uppercase and lowercase characters differently. This applies to identifiers too. You must avoid using the same name with different cases while naming identifiers.\n",
    "Q4//  what is the correct extension of python file?\n",
    "ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a widely used programming or coding language used for different purposes. The extensions for Python files are - . py, . pyi, .\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5//   is python code compiled or interpreted?\n",
    "ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "    Python is an interpreted language, which means the source code of a Python program is converted into bytecode that is then executed by the Python virtual machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6// name a few blocks of code used to define in python language.\n",
    "ans:-\n",
    "  The following are blocks: a module, a function body, and a class definition. Each command typed interactively is a block. A script file (a file given as standard input to the interpreter or specified as a command line argument to the interpreter) is a code block.\n",
    "Q7//  character used to single line commentin python language.\n",
    "ans:-\n",
    "We can write a single-line comment by adding a single # character before any statement or line of code.\n",
    "Q8//  mentioned the function which can help us to find the verson of the python.\n",
    "ans:-\n",
    "We can also use the .python_version() method present in the platform module to print the version of the Python interpreter installed on the system.\n",
    "Q9//  python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime.\n",
    "ans:-\n",
    "Python supports the creation of anonymous functions  at runtime, using a construct called lambda.\n",
    "Q10//  what does pip stand for python?\n",
    "ans:-\n",
    "PIP is a package manager for Python packages.\n",
    "Q11// some built in function in python.\n",
    "ans:-\n",
    "iter()\tReturns an iterator object\n",
    "int()\tReturns an integer number\n",
    "input()\tAllowing user input\n",
    "len()\tReturns the length of an object\n",
    "list()\tReturns a list\n",
    "print()\tPrints to the standard output device\n",
    "range()\tReturns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 and increments by 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Q12//  what may be the maximum possible length of a identifier in python?\n",
    "ans :-\n",
    "An identifier can have a maximum length of 79 characters in Python. \n",
    "Q13//  what are the benefits of using python ?\n",
    "ans :-\n",
    "Python programming is a general-purpose skill used in almost all fields, including: \n",
    "\n",
    "Data science\n",
    "Scientific and mathematical computing\n",
    "Web development\n",
    "Finance and trading\n",
    "System automation and administration\n",
    "Computer graphics\n",
    "Q14//  how is memory managed in python?\n",
    "ans :-\n",
    "Memory in Python is managed by Python private heap space. All Python objects and data structures are located in a private heap. This private heap is taken care of by Python Interpreter itself, and a programmer doesn't have access to this private heap.\n",
    "Q15//  \n",
    "ans:-\n",
    "First we nee to download python editor(pychamp,anaconda) from browser and instell it .\n",
    "The complete path of python.exe can be added by:\n",
    ":-Right-clicking This PC and going to Properties.\n",
    ":-Clicking on the Advanced system settings in the menu on the left.\n",
    ":-Clicking on the Environment Variables button oâ€‹n the bottom right.\n",
    ":-In the System variables section, selecting the Path variable and clicking on Edit.\n",
    "Q16//  Is indentation required in python?\n",
    "ans:-\n",
    "The indentation in Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code."
